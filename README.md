# Progetto-CUDA

The Gauss Jordan method was implemented for the resolution of systems of first degree equations using CUDA.
File named "Relazione_MCdF__CUDA.pdf" is a written report of the whole work (in italian). 
To create the matrix and find the exact solutions was used Mathematica, a cross-platform symbolic and numerical computing environment.
"GaussJordan.cpp" file contains the simple resolution of the system with Gauss Jordan method written in c++, indeed, not parallelized. "GaussJordanCuda.cu" resolves the system with parallel computing.
